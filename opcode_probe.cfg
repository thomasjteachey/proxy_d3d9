# Spirit healer opcode probe configuration
# Copy this file next to the built proxy module (d3d9.dll / proxy_d3d9.dll) inside your WoW folder.
# The probe code automatically looks for opcode_probe.cfg in the same directory as the DLL.

# Select probe mode:
#   discover - hook Winsock send/recv APIs and dump call stacks to find callsites
#   winsock  - log Winsock sends with stack signatures and wow+RVAs
phase = winsock

[watch]
# Record the stack signature that fires when you click a spirit guide.
